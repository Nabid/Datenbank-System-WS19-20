For the given points and queries, we found the results of KNN and KNNZCurve differs not that much.
But we strongly believe that completely depends on the given set of number of points and queries.
The difference we observed is due to the distance function (distribution of points in Cartesian plane and in Z Curve), for KNN we considered Eucledean distance 
and for KNNZCurve we considered Z value from byte string of x and y.

For distance on a plane between two vector points, we consider the shortest distance between them.

The Manhattan or Taxicab distance d, between two vectors p and q in an n-dimensional real vector space with
fixed Cartesian coordinate system, is the sum of the lengths of the projections of the line segment between the points onto the coordinate axes.
